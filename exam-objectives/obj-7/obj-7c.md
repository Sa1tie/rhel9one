# Objective: Configure network services to start automatically at boot
###############################################

# Purpose:
# Ensuring network services start automatically at boot is crucial for
# maintaining network connectivity and accessibility without manual intervention.

# Details:
# Network services such as networking, DHCP, DNS, and others need to be configured
# to start automatically when the system boots up. This ensures that critical
# networking functionality is available as soon as the system is online.

# Examples and Commands:
# To configure a network service to start automatically, use the systemctl command
# with the enable option. For example, to enable the networking service:
sudo systemctl enable --now NetworkManager.service

# Use Cases:
# Example: Ensuring NetworkManager starts at boot for managing network connections.
# Data: systemctl enable --now NetworkManager.service

# ELI5 (Explain Like I'm 5):
# When your computer starts, it needs to connect to the network. By telling it
# to start the network services automatically, you make sure it's ready to go
# online without needing you to do anything extra.

# Practice Tips:
# - Practice enabling and disabling different network services using systemctl.
# - Verify service status after enabling to ensure they are running correctly.
# - Understand the dependencies of network services to avoid connectivity issues.
