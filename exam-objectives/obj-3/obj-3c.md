# RHCSA RHEL9 Exam Objective: Interrupt the boot process
###############################################################

# Purpose:
Interrupting the boot process allows system administrators to gain access to a system for troubleshooting, maintenance, or recovery purposes without fully booting into the operating system.

# Details:
Interrupting the boot process involves accessing the GRUB (Grand Unified Bootloader) menu during system startup. From here, administrators can modify kernel parameters or select different boot options to enter troubleshooting or rescue modes.

# Examples and Commands:
## Accessing GRUB menu during boot:
- Reboot or power on the system.
- When the GRUB menu appears (usually after BIOS/UEFI), press any key to interrupt the automatic boot process.

## Modifying boot options:
- Select the desired kernel version or edit an existing entry.
- Append `rd.break` to the end of the `linux` line to break into the initial RAM filesystem (initramfs) shell.

## Booting into rescue mode:
- Append `systemd.unit=rescue.target` to the `linux` line to boot into rescue mode, allowing root access to the filesystem.

# Use Cases:
- Resetting a forgotten root password.
- Repairing a system that fails to boot properly.
- Modifying system configurations that prevent normal boot.

# ELI5 (Explain Like I'm 5):
Imagine your computer is like a car. Normally, it starts and goes straight to where you want to go. But sometimes, you need to stop it right after it starts to fix something under the hood. That's what interrupting the boot process doesâ€”it lets you stop the computer before it finishes starting up, so you can fix things.

# Practice Tips:
- Practice accessing the GRUB menu on a virtual machine or spare system.
- Experiment with different boot options like `rd.break` and `rescue.target` to understand their effects.
- Familiarize yourself with common troubleshooting scenarios that require interrupting the boot process.
