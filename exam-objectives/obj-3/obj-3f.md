# Manage Tuning Profiles #
###########################

# Objective:
# Manage tuning profiles to optimize system performance.

# Purpose:
# Tuning profiles allow system administrators to adjust system parameters to enhance performance, depending on specific workload requirements.

# Details:
# Tuning profiles in RHEL9OS enable administrators to configure settings related to CPU, memory, disk I/O, and other system resources. This helps in optimizing performance based on workload characteristics, such as high-performance computing, virtualization, or general-purpose use.

# Examples and Commands:
# List available tuning profiles:
tuned-adm list

# Activate a specific tuning profile (replace 'profile_name' with the desired profile):
tuned-adm profile profile_name

# Check the active profile:
tuned-adm active

# Use Cases:
# Example 1: Optimizing a server for virtualization workload:
# - Use a tuning profile that prioritizes CPU and memory allocation.
# - Enhance disk I/O settings for better performance under heavy virtualization.

# Example 2: Configuring a server for database operations:
# - Select a profile that adjusts caching and disk I/O parameters.
# - Optimize CPU scheduling and memory management for database queries.

# ELI5 (Explain Like I'm 5):
# Think of tuning profiles like different outfits you wear for different activities. If you're playing soccer, you wear cleats and sportswear; if you're going swimming, you wear a swimsuit. Each outfit (tuning profile) is designed to make that activity (workload) easier and more effective.

# Practice Tips:
# - Practice switching between different tuning profiles.
# - Experiment with different profiles and observe performance changes using system monitoring tools.
# - Understand the impact of each profile on CPU, memory, and disk usage to choose the right one for specific tasks.
