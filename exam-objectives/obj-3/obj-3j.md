# RHCSA Exam Objective: Securely transfer files between systems
###############################################################

# Purpose:
# Securely transferring files between systems is crucial for system administrators to ensure data integrity, confidentiality, and availability across networks. This objective focuses on using secure protocols and tools to accomplish file transfers securely.

# Details:
# Secure file transfer involves using protocols like SSH (Secure Shell) and tools like scp (secure copy) or rsync over SSH. These methods encrypt data during transmission, preventing unauthorized access and tampering.

# Examples and Commands:
# 1. Using scp (secure copy) to transfer files securely:
scp /path/to/local/file username@remotehost:/path/to/destination/

# 2. Using rsync over SSH for efficient and secure file synchronization:
rsync -avz -e ssh /path/to/source username@remotehost:/path/to/destination/

# Use Cases:
# - Transferring configuration files securely between servers.
# - Backing up critical data over a network securely.
# - Distributing software updates across a cluster of servers.

# ELI5 (Explain Like I'm 5):
# Imagine you have secret messages to send to your friend across the playground. You put your messages in a special locked box (encryption) and give it to a trusted adult (secure protocol). They take it safely to your friend without anyone else being able to read it.

# Practice Tips:
# - Practice transferring files between virtual machines or different systems on your network using both scp and rsync over SSH.
# - Understand SSH key-based authentication to securely automate file transfers without passwords.
# - Explore different options of rsync such as excluding files/directories or preserving permissions during transfers.
