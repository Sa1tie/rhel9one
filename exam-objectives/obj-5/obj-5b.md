# Objective: Mount and unmount network file systems using NFS
###########################################################

# Purpose:
# NFS (Network File System) allows remote access to files over a network. 
# Mounting NFS shares enables users to access files on remote systems as if they were local.

# Details:
# Mounting NFS shares involves connecting to a remote NFS server and making its file system accessible locally.
# This is crucial for sharing data and resources across networked systems efficiently.

# Examples and Commands:

# To mount an NFS share from a server (replace server_ip and /remote_directory with your specifics):
sudo mount -t nfs server_ip:/remote_directory /local_mount_point

# To unmount an NFS share:
sudo umount /local_mount_point

# Use Cases:
# 1. Sharing centralized data storage across multiple servers.
# 2. Accessing remote application data or configuration files.
# 3. Providing shared resources like home directories or software repositories.

# ELI5 (Explain Like I'm 5):
# Imagine your friend has toys you want to play with. Mounting NFS is like bringing those toys to your home temporarily so you can play with them, and unmounting is putting them back when you're done.

# Practice Tips:
# - Practice mounting and unmounting NFS shares from different servers.
# - Understand NFS permissions and security considerations.
# - Experiment with automounting NFS shares at system boot for seamless access.
