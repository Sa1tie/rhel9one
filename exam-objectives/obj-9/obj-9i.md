# Objective: Diagnose and address routine SELinux policy violations
##############################################################################

# Purpose:
# SELinux (Security-Enhanced Linux) enforces mandatory access control policies
# to enhance system security. Understanding how to diagnose and resolve routine
# policy violations is crucial for maintaining a secure system.

# Details:
# SELinux policies define rules for how processes and users interact with
# system resources. Violations occur when a process tries to access a resource
# in a way that violates these rules. Diagnosing and resolving these violations
# involves interpreting SELinux denials and adjusting policies or contexts as
# necessary.

# Examples and Commands:
# 1. Check SELinux status and mode:
$ sestatus

# 2. View SELinux denials in audit logs:
$ sudo grep "avc: " /var/log/audit/audit.log | less

# 3. Identify context mismatches:
$ ls -lZ /path/to/file
$ ps auxZ | grep <process_name>

# 4. Use audit2allow to generate SELinux policy modules:
$ sudo audit2allow -a -M mypolicy

# 5. Apply generated policy module:
$ sudo semodule -i mypolicy.pp

# Use Cases:
# - Scenario: Apache HTTP server fails to serve content due to SELinux denying
#   access to necessary files.
# - Resolution: Identify denials in audit logs, adjust file contexts or create
#   custom SELinux policy modules to allow necessary access.

# ELI5 (Explain Like I'm 5):
# SELinux is like a guard that watches how everyone in your computer behaves.
# Sometimes it says "No" when someone tries to do something they shouldn't.
# Diagnosing SELinux problems means figuring out why the guard said "No" and
# telling it when it's okay to say "Yes."

# Practice Tips:
# - Regularly review SELinux denials in audit logs to become familiar with common
#   issues.
# - Practice using audit2allow to generate and apply policy modules for resolving
#   SELinux denials.
# - Experiment with adjusting file contexts and user roles to understand their
#   impact on SELinux policies.
