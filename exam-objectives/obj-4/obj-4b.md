# Objective: Create and remove physical volumes
##############################################

# Purpose:
# Physical volumes (PVs) are essential components in LVM (Logical Volume Management). They represent the underlying storage devices that can be combined into volume groups (VGs) and further divided into logical volumes (LVs). Understanding how to create and remove PVs is crucial for managing storage efficiently in RHEL environments.

# Details:
# Creating a physical volume involves initializing a storage device to be used by LVM. Removing a physical volume deallocates the storage device from LVM, allowing it to be used elsewhere or repurposed.

# Examples and Commands:

# Create a physical volume on /dev/sdb1
sudo pvcreate /dev/sdb1

# Remove a physical volume (confirm with 'y' when prompted)
sudo pvremove /dev/sdb1

# Use Cases:
# - Adding new disks to increase storage capacity in an existing LVM setup.
# - Replacing or decommissioning old disks while maintaining data integrity through LVM.
# - Preparing disks for use with LVM in scenarios where dynamic storage allocation is beneficial.

# ELI5 (Explain Like I'm 5):
# Think of physical volumes as containers that store all your toys (data). Creating a physical volume is like getting a new box to keep more toys, and removing it is like emptying the box to use it for something else.

# Practice Tips:
# - Practice creating and removing physical volumes on different types of storage devices (HDDs, SSDs, etc.).
# - Understand the implications of removing a physical volume, such as data loss if not properly managed.
# - Familiarize yourself with related commands like `pvdisplay`, `pvscan`, and `pvs` to monitor and manage physical volumes effectively.
