# RHCSA Exam Objective: Assign Physical Volumes to Volume Groups
###############################

# Purpose:
# This objective focuses on managing storage in Linux by assigning physical volumes (PVs)
# to volume groups (VGs). Understanding this process is crucial for effectively utilizing
# and managing storage resources on Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL).

# Details:
# Physical volumes (PVs) are individual storage devices or partitions that are utilized
# by LVM (Logical Volume Manager). Volume groups (VGs) are created by combining one or
# more physical volumes. Assigning physical volumes to volume groups allows administrators
# to aggregate storage capacity and manage it more flexibly using logical volumes (LVs).

# Examples and Commands:

# 1. Display existing physical volumes:
pvdisplay

# 2. Display existing volume groups:
vgdisplay

# 3. Create a new physical volume from a disk or partition:
pvcreate /dev/sdb1

# 4. Create a new volume group and assign physical volumes to it:
vgcreate vg_data /dev/sdb1 /dev/sdc1

# 5. Display detailed information about a specific volume group:
vgdisplay vg_data

# 6. Extend an existing volume group with additional physical volumes:
vgextend vg_data /dev/sdd1

# 7. Reduce the size of a volume group by removing physical volumes:
vgreduce vg_data /dev/sdc1

# Use Cases:
# - Scenario: Adding new disks to a server and incorporating them into existing storage pools.
# - Scenario: Scaling storage capacity for database servers by dynamically adding physical disks.
# - Scenario: Repurposing older disks by reallocating them to new or existing volume groups.

# ELI5 (Explain Like I'm 5):
# Imagine you have a bunch of toy boxes (physical volumes) and you want to combine them
# into bigger toy chests (volume groups) to store all your toys more efficiently. Assigning
# physical volumes to volume groups is like deciding which toy boxes go into which big toy chests.

# Practice Tips:
# - Practice creating and managing physical volumes and volume groups in a virtualized environment.
# - Experiment with extending and reducing volume groups to understand the impact on storage allocation.
# - Explore different scenarios where adding or removing physical volumes affects storage availability.

# End of Objective.
